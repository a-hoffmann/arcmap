the cost layer is made of:
- distance between villages (buffer)
- topography (ridges and slope)
- rivers
\\\possibly extend to land use

cost=costlayer="E_ridgecost1"+'stream_cost3'+'Reclass_slop2'+'Reclass_dist4' 

E_ridgecost1 made with inversed DEM and stream network (more details here http://support.esri.com/en/knowledgebase/techarticles/detail/39093)
ridges given cost 100, rest set to 0.001 (0) -> based on stream orders of inversed streams
stream_cost3 was made with flowdir, flow acc, and stream orders (straehler)
different cost given to different order
Reclass_slop2 is a reclassed normalised slope to give it values 1-9 rather than 0-1
reclass_dist4 is a reclassification of a 500m buffer around village poligons. 100 is out of buffer, 1cost is within
