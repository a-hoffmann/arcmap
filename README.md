arcmap
======

here is a selection of python snippets I am working on to process some GIS data using the python window in ESRI arcmap 10.2.

I have a set of settlement (shapefile) data, and the aim is to join some polygons that may be close enough to eachother. This is being done based on a set of costs calculated through arcmap. if the cost path between two settlements is low enough, the two polygons will be marked and joined.
